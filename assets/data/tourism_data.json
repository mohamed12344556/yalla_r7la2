The desert gets its name from the white color of the chalk rock formations, which contrast dramatically with the golden sand.

    "context": "A Nile cruise is one of the most popular ways to experience Egypt's ancient wonders. Most cruises operate between Luxor and Aswan, with stops at major temples and archaeological sites along the way. The journey covers about 200 km of the Nile River, passing through landscapes that have changed little since pharaonic times. Cruise ships range from standard to ultra-luxury, with most offering guided excursions to the monuments. The typical cruise lasts 3-7 nights, though some extend to Cairo or include Lake Nasser. Sailing on the Nile offers a unique perspective on Egypt's ancient civilization, as many historical sites were built along the river, which was the country's lifeline."

    "context": "St. Catherine is a small town located at the foot of Mount Sinai in the South Sinai Governorate of Egypt. It's home to St. Catherine's Monastery, one of the oldest working Christian monasteries in the world, dating back to the 6th century. The monastery is built around what is believed to be the biblical Burning Bush and houses a remarkable collection of religious icons and ancient manuscripts, second only to the Vatican. Mount Sinai (also known as Gebel Musa) is revered as the place where Moses received the Ten Commandments. Many visitors climb the mountain before dawn to witness the spectacular sunrise from the summit. The area is also home to Bedouin communities who maintain their traditional way of life and offer insights into desert culture and survival."

It's one of Egypt's oldest cities, with a history dating back to the Pharaonic era. The region is known for its natural beauty, combining desert landscapes, lakes, waterfalls, and agricultural land. Wadi El Hitan (Valley of the Whales) is a UNESCO World Heritage site containing invaluable fossil remains of the earliest forms of whales. Tunis Village has become an artists' colony known for its pottery. The oasis offers a peaceful retreat from Cairo's hustle and bustle, with opportunities for bird watching, fossil hunting, pottery making, and relaxing by the lakes."
